        "description": "For my final year dissertation, I developed a procedural dungeon generator in Unity using C#. The project focused on investigating and implementing algorithms for generating dungeon levels with rooms of varying sizes and interconnected tunnels. Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm was used to determine how rooms are connected, while A* Search controlled the pathfinding for tunnels between rooms. The system enables the creation of unpredictable, replayable dungeon layouts, demonstrating the benefits of procedural content generation in game development. I achieved a first for the completed project and dissertation.",
